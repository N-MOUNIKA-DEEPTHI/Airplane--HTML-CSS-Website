            <h1>Welcome to Seashore Hotel</h1>
            <p>Experience the ultimate comfort and relaxation at our hotel.On the southern end of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, three different beach
                 lodging establishments were created on the same property during three different time periods. There is no doubt that this location is 
                 desired by many hotel owners. The narrow part of the island offers sound and ocean views along with small southern town charm.In 1897 
                 the Seashore Hotel open their doors to the public in 1897 on 275 Waynick Blvd. This hotel had 150 rooms and 100 rocking chairs available 
                 to their guests on an Oceanside porch. A porter was hired to constantly keep the chairs in line. Each room was also equipped with a fireplace. 
                 This hotel was a colonial style establishment with cream and white exterior. Because you could only get on the island by trolley, the hotel 
                 was located on “station 3” for east accessibility. The Seashore Hotel had three floors consisting of the guest rooms, a large dining area, 
                 a ladies reception room, a sitting room, and an office. On opening day, the hotel offered a supper with a live orchestra.
                  On the Oceanside of the resort was a famous large steel pier.
